/*
* Every object has a toString() method that is automatically
* called when the object is to be represented as a text value
* or when an object is referred to in a manner in which a
* string is expected. By default, the toString() method is
* inherited by every object descended from Object. If this
* method is not overridden in a custom object, toString()
* returns "[object type]", where type is the object type.
* The following code illustrates this:

var o = {foo: 'bar'};
